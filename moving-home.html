                    Moving home is a stressful process which comes with so many
                    tasks for people to carry out. The last thing people want to

                    this journey seamless and understandable was a priority.

                  <p>
                    Within the journey of moving out, if an existing customer
                    chooses to carry energy/gas supply from Shell Energy with
                    them to their new property, they get treated as a new energy
                    customer/submission. Functionally, this is how the back-end
                    handled this process.
                  </p>
                </div>

                  <h3>Re-entering personal details</h3>

                  <p class="pb-4">
                    Due to the back-end treating the user as a new energy
                    submission, the front end did too, and required them to
                    re-enter all details such as; personal details, address
                    details/ history, payment details and marketing preferences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This provided a jarring journey which was far too taxing for
                    the user, rather than creating a new experience tailored to
                    the users' needs. This way of retrieving customer data
                    simply provided extra clicks and potentially a lack of trust
                    from a user.

                    The proposed solution managed to reduce the time-on-task by
                    over 90%! Previously, it would take users 4 minutes to
                    complete this task, now, it takes around 20 seconds!

                    clicks-to-value from 25 to 1. Also, reducing the number of
                    screens from 6 down to 2.

                  Initially working with product owners, developers and other
                  members of the UX team; we mapped out the journey to
                  brainstorm problem areas and necessary steps within the
                  process.

                </p>

                <p>
                  An existing customer registering a new energy account with
                  Shell Energy was a poor experience, since they already had an
                  account with us, this may cause anxiety surrounding their
                  energy account, credit or debt.

                  <p>
                    An initial solution was to pre-populate the form fields,
                    while this solved the problem of treating existing customers
                    as new customers, the issue remains in a poor UX - affirming
                    their details on 4 separate pages; personal, address, switch
                    date and payment, it provided a similarly long experience.

                  <p>
                    In this iteration we removed the need for the user to
                    re-enter personal information by making an API request to
                    their current account details to pull the data. Then
                    pre-populating the form fields on a single summary screen.

                  <p>
                    In this iteration we paid attention to the context of the
                    user journey, and provided copy on the summary screen
                    referring to the previous function, to provide a more
                    seamless experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We also removed the faster switching screen and asking the
                    question at the bottom of the new summary screen, while
                    pre-selecting the ‘faster switch’ option as 90% of users
                    selected this.

                  <p>
                    Another feature removed was marketing preferences. This was
                    done as to remove more features a user typically wouldn’t
                    care about - they simply want to register their new home as
                    quickly as possible and getting ready to move home, not
                    worry about marketing preferences.

                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    The thank you screen provided a back-end pass of the moving
                    home data the user previously entered, as things like their
                    tariff needed to be carried over. Although, it seemed to
                    just provide an extra click and while it helped users better
                    understand where they were going, this could be solved with
                    copy on the summary screen.

                    Since we were using user data in this way, I also worked

                          didn’t switch payment methods here. Also, giving users
                          the choice to change payment method, as they’re moving
                          house, they may need to start paying with a different
                          account.
